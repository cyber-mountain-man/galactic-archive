# 🌌 Galactic Archive

> *Preserving the knowledge of the cosmos — one entry at a time.*

**Galactic Archive** is a sci-fi inspired web application built with **Go**, **htmx**, and **Bulma**. Designed to feel like a futuristic knowledge interface from a galactic empire, the archive catalogs fictional planets, technologies, events, and species — paying tribute to classics like **Dune**, **Star Trek**, and the **Foundation series**.

This project is both a creative worldbuilding sandbox and a professional demonstration of modern full-stack web development using Go.

## 🚀 Stack Overview

| Layer        | Technology     | Purpose                                |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Backend      | Go (`net/http`) | Server-side routing, templating, and logic |
| Frontend     | htmx           | Dynamic, reactive frontend without JS frameworks |
| CSS Framework| Bulma          | Clean, responsive UI with sci-fi vibes |
| Templates    | `html/template`| Componentized, server-rendered views   |
| Data Layer   | JSON / SQLite  | Portable storage of archive entries    |

## 🧪 Features

- 🪐 View and explore planets, factions, artifacts, and historical events
- 📜 Each entry is dynamically loaded using htmx (`hx-get`, `hx-swap`)
- 🧬 Search and filter entries by type, region, or status
- 🛠️ Admin panel (in progress): add and edit entries through the UI
- 🎨 Stylish retro-futuristic layout using Bulma and minimal custom CSS

---

## 💡 Learning Goals

This project was created to:

- Learn and apply the **Go + htmx** stack effectively
- Build a modular, extensible codebase for server-rendered web apps
- Explore creative frontend design using **Bulma** as a base
- Demonstrate real-world usage of `html/template`, dynamic routing, and lightweight client-server interactions

## 🧠 Inspiration

This app is inspired by the idea of a **central galactic database** — like the Federation's Memory Alpha, the Imperial Archives of Trantor, or the Bene Gesserit’s hidden knowledge repositories. It’s a tribute to speculative fiction’s belief in the preservation of knowledge and the beauty of structured information.
